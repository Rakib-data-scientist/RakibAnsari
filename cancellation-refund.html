            <p><a href="https://rakibansari.com/">rakibansari.com</a> Refund & Cancellation Policy [cite: 139]</p>

            <h3>Refund Policy</h3>
            <p>All payments made for our services are <strong>non-refundable</strong>. [cite: 141] Once the payment has been completed through the website, UPI, bank transfer, card, NEFT, or any third party payment gateway, the transaction is considered final. [cite: 142] This is because the Service requires time, manpower, research, sourcing and screening efforts that begin immediately after receiving confirmation. [cite: 143]</p>

            <h3>Cancellation Policy</h3>
            <p>Once a service engagement has been confirmed, it <strong>cannot be cancelled</strong>. [cite: 145] If you decide to discontinue the service midway, all payments made remain non-refundable and the client will remain liable to pay for work already completed up to the point of discontinuation. [cite: 146]</p>

            <p>Please review all details of the service, pricing and agreement terms before making a payment or confirming engagement. [cite: 147]</p>
