            <h2 class="section-title">My Story</h2>
            <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Rakib Ansari</strong>, I'm the founder of a staffing and recruitment agency that helps companies and startups hire dependable and highly skilled talent, especially developers and tech professionals.</p>
            <p>I stepped into the world of recruitment after working closely with early stage startups and growing tech companies. I noticed the same challenge everywhere: teams were ambitious, products were promising, and growth targets were clear, but hiring the right developers always slowed everything down. This hiring bottleneck inspired me to focus full-time on solving one thing, helping businesses hire the right talent faster.</p>
            <p>I began by supporting small tech teams with their first technical hires. With time, I started working with funded startups and global companies that needed specialists, remote developers, long term contractors, or entire technical teams. Through this journey, I developed a structured hiring approach built around screening for technical skills, work ethic, communication ability, and cultural fit. The four things that create high-performing teams.</p>
            <p>Today, I work directly with founders, CTOs and HR leaders to eliminate the stress of recruitment so they can focus on growth. My work is exclusively for employers who need reliable, vetted talent.</p>
