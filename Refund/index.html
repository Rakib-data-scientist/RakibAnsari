            <h3>Refund Policy</h3>
            <p>All payments made for our services are <strong>non-refundable</strong>. Once the payment has been completed through the website, UPI, bank transfer, card, NEFT, or any third party payment gateway, the transaction is considered final. This is because the Service requires time, manpower, research, sourcing and screening efforts that begin immediately after receiving confirmation.</p>

            <h3>Cancellation Policy</h3>
            <p>Once a service engagement has been confirmed, it <strong>cannot be cancelled</strong>. If you decide to discontinue the service midway, all payments made remain non-refundable and the client will remain liable to pay for work already completed up to the point of discontinuation.</p>

            <p>Please review all details of the service, pricing and agreement terms before making a payment or confirming engagement.</p>
